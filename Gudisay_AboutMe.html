                        <p>My name is Likhit Gudisay. I am a thirteen year old high school student at Dublin High School. I am an aspiring young software developer. In the future, I hope to learn new coding languages and software tools. One short term goal of mine is to graduate from high school with a 4.0 GPA or higher. I also want to continue to create new websites or an application in high school. MY long term goals include wanting to attend Duke University or MIT. I want a major in a Tech field. These are just some of my many goals.</p>
                        <p>I have many traits that can be helpful in the world of computers. I am known to be calm and collective. I do not lash out in anger no matter the severity of the situation. My persistent and patient nature allows me to solve a problem even when the solution is hard to find. My personality can be beneficial in this field.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the past couple years, I have participated in many software related tasks. I have made multiple websites, created code for robots, and participated in coding competitions. I also have participated in a cyber security competition. I contain basic knowledge in nearly all the subdivisions of the tech field. I am also good at math and logical thinking. My experience in this field makes me more knowledgeable and experienced.</p>
